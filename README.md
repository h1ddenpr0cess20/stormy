# Stormy

A weather voice agent rendered as an umbrella — dry, ominous, quietly delighted
by a front coming through, and useless at small talk about nice days. It runs on
an xAI Grok speech-to-speech session, and the canopy's flutter, sway and squash
are driven by the live audio, so it moves with whichever of you is talking.

It searches the web for every forecast it gives — weather from a model's memory
is a guess — and can call remote MCP servers. It also remembers what you tell it
to, between calls.

## Run

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # add your XAI_API_KEY
npm run dev               # → http://localhost:5173
```

Click the mic, allow the browser's microphone prompt, and ask about the sky.
Talk over him and he stops — and blows inside out.

The mic button is a microphone switch, not a hang-up: turning it off stops what
you send and leaves the answer playing, and the conversation is still there when
you turn it back on. It also switches itself off after a minute of silence, and
the call survives that too.

| Script | |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite, with the proxy mounted as middleware — one process |
| `npm run dev:lan` | The same, over HTTPS on the network — for a phone |
| `npm run build` | Bundles the client to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Serves `dist/` with the same proxy in front |
| `npm run preview` | `build` then `start` |
| `npm run preview:lan` | `build` then `start`, over HTTPS on the network |
| `npm test` | `node:test`, against a stub xAI socket |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

CI runs the lint, the tests on Node 22.12 and 24, and a build that then has to
boot and serve itself over both HTTP and HTTPS.

## Configuration

Both `npm run dev` and `npm start` read `.env`.

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `XAI_API_KEY` | — | Required. Stays in the Node process. |
| `XAI_VOICE` | `helix` | Any of the 26 voices xAI publishes — the full list is in `.env.example`. Any other voice id is honoured and added to the picker. |
| `XAI_MODEL` | `grok-voice-latest` | Also `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` |
| `XAI_REALTIME_URL` | xAI | Points the proxy at a gateway or a stub |
| `XAI_WEB_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `XAI_X_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `MEMORY` | `true` | The `remember` and `forget` tools, and the memory block in the prompt |
| `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` | — | JSON array of remote MCP servers, or put it in `mcp.json` |
| `PORT` | `5173` | |
| `SSL_KEY`, `SSL_CERT` | — | Paths to a real certificate; `npm start` then serves HTTPS |

### On a phone

```sh
npm run dev:lan           # → https://192.168.x.x:5173, printed on start
```

Microphone access needs a secure context. `localhost` is one; a LAN address over
plain HTTP is not — `navigator.mediaDevices` doesn't exist there, so the page
can't even raise the mic prompt. The `:lan` scripts serve HTTPS with a
self-signed certificate, cached in `node_modules/.vite/`, and the realtime
socket follows the page onto `wss:`.

No browser trusts that certificate, so the phone shows a warning the first time
("Advanced" → proceed on Chrome, "Show details" → "visit this website" on
Safari). Tap through it once per device. To skip it, point `SSL_KEY` and
`SSL_CERT` at a certificate the device already trusts —
[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) issues one for a LAN IP.

## Docker

```sh
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 -e XAI_API_KEY=xai-... h1ddenpr0cess20/stormy
```

Images go to Docker Hub on every push to `main` (`latest`) and on `v*` tags
(`1.2.3`, `1.2`), for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Configuration is the same
set of variables as `.env` — pass them with `-e` or `--env-file .env`.

The container serves HTTP on `PORT` and expects TLS to be terminated in front of
it; to serve TLS from the container, mount a certificate and set `SSL_KEY` and
`SSL_CERT`. Build it yourself with `docker build -t stormy .`. Publishing from a
fork needs a `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret, plus a `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` variable if
your Docker Hub account isn't `h1ddenpr0cess20`.

## How the call is wired

Every frame of audio goes through the Node process:

```
browser  ──ws──▶  /realtime  ──ws──▶  wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime
```

Unlike OpenAI's Realtime API, the browser can't dial xAI directly.
`/v1/realtime/client_secrets` takes no `session` field, so a page dialling xAI
itself would have to send its own `session.update` — putting the persona, the
tool list and any MCP `authorization` header in client code. The token also
lasts five minutes, and conversations routinely outlive that.

So the socket lives here and the page holds no credential. On connect the proxy
sends `session.update` — persona, voice, turn detection, audio format, tools —
before forwarding anything the page queued.

What the page may send upstream is an allowlist: audio frames, a typed message,
a request to respond, a cancel, and the output of a function call it ran itself.
Two things are dropped as persona overrides — a `session.update` from the
browser, and the `instructions` field on a `response.create`.
`test/server/realtime.test.js` covers that.

One frame type never reaches xAI: `session.memory`, which the page sends with
what it has stored. The proxy folds those lines into the instructions and
re-sends its own `session.update`, so the persona stays here and the memories
stay in the browser.

## Audio

A WebSocket carrying base64 PCM leaves both directions to the client.

**Up:** an `AudioWorklet` (`public/pcm-worklet.js`) takes the mic at whatever
rate the hardware gives, resamples to 24 kHz with linear interpolation, and
posts 20 ms PCM16 frames. The `sampleRate` option on `AudioContext` is only a
hint, so the conversion is done rather than requested.

**Down:** chunks arrive faster than real time, so each is booked against a
cursor running ahead of the clock rather than played as it lands. That cursor is
also what makes barge-in work — interrupting drops everything booked but not yet
heard.

Turn-taking is server-side VAD. `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` tells the
page to drop its queue; a `response.created` arriving while audio is still
playing flushes it too, as a backstop. `Escape` cancels for the typed path.

The worklet lives in `public/` rather than being imported, because Vite inlines
small assets as `data:text/javascript` URLs and `addModule()` rejects those on
Safari and under any CSP that disallows `data:`.

## History

Every completed turn is written to `localStorage` under `stormy.history.v1`, one
record per call, and the `log` button in the composer opens them newest first.
`new` closes the record and, if a call is up, dials again — the model's memory of
what was said is the call itself, so a new call is the only thing that clears it.

Nothing is uploaded: the log is in the browser that made the call, the proxy
never sees it, and `clear` — which asks once — removes it. The last 40
conversations are kept, and the oldest are shed to stay inside a 300 KB budget,
since that space belongs to the whole origin. Private-mode Safari hands back a
store that throws on write, so the log falls back to memory for the life of the
page rather than failing the call.

Old turns are not replayed into a new call. That would make the log a memory
rather than a record, and `session.tools` has no path for it that doesn't also
let the page rewrite the persona.

## Tools

`web_search` and `x_search` are on by default. Both execute inside xAI, so
there's nothing to implement here and no second credential to hold. Stormy is
told not to narrate a search; the only sign one is running is the label under
the status chip.

Remote MCP servers go in `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` as a JSON array, or in `mcp.json`
(gitignored), and are also executed by xAI:

```json
[
  {
    "server_label": "orders",
    "server_url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
    "server_description": "Order lookup",
    "allowed_tools": ["lookup_order"],
    "authorization": "Bearer ..."
  }
]
```

Credentials there never leave the Node process — `/api/config` reports tool
labels only. `remember` and `forget` are the two tools that run here rather than
at xAI.

## Memory

The log is a record. Memory is what Stormy carries into the next call: a short
list of details, kept in `localStorage` under `stormy.memory.v1` and appended to
the persona as a labelled block when the call opens.

Ask him to remember something and he calls `remember`; ask him to forget it and
he calls `forget`, which drops every stored line matching the keyword. Both run
in the page against browser storage, and the result goes back up as a
`function_call_output`. The `memory` button opens the list, where you can add a
line by hand, drop one, switch the whole thing off, or clear it.

The list is capped at 25 lines, each flattened to one line and cut at 600
characters; past the cap the oldest goes. Editing it during a call re-sends
`session.memory`, so a memory added mid-conversation is live in it. Switching
memory off empties the block on the next `session.update` without deleting
anything, and `MEMORY=false` removes the tools and the prompt block entirely.

Memories are text the person typed or dictated, so they land inside the prompt.
Flattening and capping them in `persona.js` keeps a memory from opening a new
instruction paragraph, and the persona is always first in the string.

## States

`idle` · `listening` · `thinking` · `speaking` — each a set of targets for
tremor, lean, sway, sway speed, twirl and how hard the fabric ripples. It eases
between them, so transitions read as a change of mood rather than a cut.

The call maps onto them directly: `listening` from `speech_started` and between
turns, `thinking` from `speech_stopped` until the first audio frame, `speaking`
while there is audio booked, `idle` when there is no call.

Two moods map to no conversational state:

- `gust` is being talked over. The canopy snaps inside out, the whole rig
  shudders, and it blends over whatever he was doing, decaying back over a
  couple of seconds.
- `furled` is what a broken API looks like — a failed dial, a proxy that isn't
  running, a missing key, an error mid-call. The fabric gathers down the shaft
  and he packs himself away until something works again. The caption says what
  broke; nothing else in the app causes it.

Every visible movement is a damped spring reacting to an impulse rather than a
sine wave, and the canopy has a spring of its own — `open` is sprung rather than
set, which is why it pops past wide when it opens and shudders when the wind
takes it. While he talks the impulses come from onsets in the audio envelope, so
the squash lands on consonants.

`src/client/stormy/` is the single-file prototype at
`prototype/umbrella-buddy.html` split into modules, with its numbers kept
verbatim — the moods, the springs and the canopy maths are unchanged. What the
app adds is who chooses the mood. `src/client/vendor/three-d-stage.js` is a
copied starter component with two local changes, listed at the top of the file —
re-copying it drops them.

The camera is the one thing the split did change. The framing is measured
against the widest and tallest the character ever gets — a canopy blown up over
its own crown — rather than where it happens to be standing, and it refits on
resize, which the starter component's one-shot vertical framing doesn't do. On a
phone held upright that's the difference between an umbrella and a wedge of one.

## The transport seam

`session/index.js` exposes `on`, `start`, `stop`, `send`, `cancel`, `syncMemory`,
`messages`, `connected`, `busy`, `stale`, `state`, `muted`, `model`, `voice` —
and emits:

```
'state'        listening | thinking | speaking | idle
'caption'      the assistant transcript for this turn, in full
'user'         what the person said, in full
'level'        0..1 sustained amplitude, per frame
'pulse'        0..1 transient, one per discrete event
'interrupted'  the person talked over Stormy
'tool'         a label while a tool works, or null
'message'      a completed turn, { role, content } — what the log stores
'busy'         whether a response is in flight
'ready'        { model, voice } the proxy actually used
'memory'       the result of a remember/forget the model just called
'done'         { usage }
'error'        { message }
```

Both transcript events carry the whole turn rather than an increment. xAI
renames OpenAI's `input_audio_transcription.delta` to `.updated` and makes it
cumulative, so appending it gives you "hello hello there hello there stormy".
`events.js` handles the two shapes apart — `.delta` appends, `.updated`
replaces.

Stormy takes audio-shaped input:

```js
stormy.setState('speaking')  // idle | listening | thinking | speaking
stormy.setLevel(0.62)        // sustained amplitude 0..1, sampled per frame
stormy.pulse(0.4)            // transient impulse 0..1, one per discrete event
stormy.gust(0.9)             // talked over: the wind takes him
stormy.furl(true)            // the API is unreachable — or, with false, it's back
```

Swapping providers means writing a different `createVoiceSession()` with that
surface. `main.js` and Stormy don't change.

## Policies

- [**AI Output Disclaimer**](docs/ai-output-disclaimer.md) — what the model says
  is the model's, not the author's, plus the risks that are specific to a live
  microphone and speech you hear before anyone can check it.
- [**Not a Companion**](docs/not-a-companion.md) — Stormy is a toy and a demo.
  It is not a friend, a therapist, or a partner, and the project will not grow in
  that direction.
