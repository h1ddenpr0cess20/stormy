# Stormy

A weather voice agent rendered as an umbrella. Dry, ominous, quietly delighted
by a front coming through, and useless at small talk about nice days. Driven by
an xAI Grok speech-to-speech session; the canopy's flutter, sway and squash are
read off the live audio, so it moves with whichever of you is talking.

It searches the web for every forecast it gives — weather from a model's memory
is a guess — and can call remote MCP servers.

## Run

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # add your XAI_API_KEY
npm run dev               # → http://localhost:5173
```

Click the mic, allow the browser's microphone prompt, and ask about the sky.
Talk over him and he'll stop — and blow inside out.

| Script | |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite, with the proxy mounted as middleware — one process |
| `npm run dev:lan` | The same, over HTTPS on the network — for a phone |
| `npm run build` | Bundles the client to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Serves `dist/` with the same proxy in front |
| `npm run preview` | `build` then `start` |
| `npm run preview:lan` | `build` then `start`, over HTTPS on the network |
| `npm test` | `node:test`, against a stub xAI socket |
| `npm run lint` | |

CI runs the lint, the tests on Node 22.12 and 24, and a build that then has to
boot and serve itself over both HTTP and HTTPS.

### On a phone

```sh
npm run dev:lan           # → https://192.168.x.x:5173, printed on start
```

Microphone access needs a secure context. `localhost` is one; a LAN address
over plain HTTP is not — `navigator.mediaDevices` isn't just refused there, it
doesn't exist, so the page can't even raise the mic prompt. The `:lan` scripts
serve HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, which is a secure context. The
realtime socket follows the page onto `wss:` by itself.

No browser trusts that certificate, so the phone shows a warning the first time
("Advanced" → proceed on Chrome, "Show details" → "visit this website" on
Safari). Tap through it once per device and the mic works from then on. The
certificate is generated on first use and cached in `node_modules/.vite/`, and
both `:lan` scripts share it, so one warning covers both.

To skip the warning entirely, bring a certificate the device already trusts —
[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) issues one for a LAN IP in a
line — and point `SSL_KEY` and `SSL_CERT` at it. `npm start` then serves HTTPS
with it and the `--https` flag is unnecessary. Same for anything public-facing.

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `XAI_API_KEY` | — | Required. Stays in the Node process. |
| `XAI_VOICE` | `helix` | Any of the 26 voices xAI publishes — the full list is in `.env.example` — or any other voice id, which is honoured and added to the picker |
| `XAI_MODEL` | `grok-voice-latest` | Also `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` |
| `XAI_REALTIME_URL` | xAI | Points the proxy at a gateway or a stub |
| `XAI_WEB_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `XAI_X_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` | — | JSON array of remote MCP servers, or put it in `mcp.json` |
| `PORT` | `5173` | |
| `SSL_KEY`, `SSL_CERT` | — | Paths to a real certificate; `npm start` then serves HTTPS |

Both `npm run dev` and `npm start` read `.env`.

## How the call is wired

Every frame of audio goes through the Node process:

```
browser  ──ws──▶  /realtime  ──ws──▶  wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime
```

That is a deliberate cost, and it is the main way this differs from an
equivalent app on OpenAI's Realtime API. There, the browser dials the provider
directly with an ephemeral secret and audio never touches your server. Here it
can't:

- **xAI's `/v1/realtime/client_secrets` takes no `session` field.** The token it
  mints carries no configuration, so a page that dialled xAI directly would have
  to send its own `session.update` — putting the persona, the tool list and any
  MCP `authorization` header in client code, where they are readable and
  editable.
- **The token lasts five minutes.** Conversations routinely outlive that.

So the socket lives here, and the page holds no credential of any kind. On
connect, the proxy is the one that sends `session.update`: persona, voice,
turn detection, audio format, tools. Only then does it forward anything the
page queued.

What the page may say upstream is an allowlist, not a filter — audio frames, a
typed message, a request to respond, a cancel. Two frames are treated as
persona overrides and dropped: a `session.update` from the browser, and the
`instructions` field on a `response.create`, which replaces the system prompt
for one turn. `test/server/realtime.test.js` is the file that fails if that
stops being true.

## Audio

WebRTC would have handled this. A WebSocket carrying base64 PCM does not, so
both directions are the client's problem.

**Up:** an `AudioWorklet` (`public/pcm-worklet.js`) takes the mic at whatever
rate the hardware felt like, resamples to 24 kHz with linear interpolation, and
posts 20 ms PCM16 frames. The `sampleRate` option on `AudioContext` is a hint —
some browsers hand back the device rate, and a session that declares 24 kHz
while sending 48 sounds like a chipmunk — so the conversion is done rather than
requested.

**Down:** chunks arrive *faster than real time* — the model produces ten seconds
of speech in two — so playback can't be "play each as it lands" without
overlapping. Each chunk is booked against a cursor running ahead of the clock.
That cursor is also what makes barge-in work: interrupting means dropping
everything booked but not yet heard, which is most of the answer.

Turn-taking is server-side VAD, so speaking over Stormy stops him generating;
`input_audio_buffer.speech_started` is what tells the page to drop its queue. A
new `response.created` arriving while audio is still playing flushes it too, as
a backstop for a turn cut short without notice. `Escape` cancels for the typed
path.

The worklet lives in `public/` rather than being imported. Vite inlines assets
under its size limit as `data:text/javascript` URLs, and `addModule()` rejects
those on Safari and under any CSP that doesn't allow `data:` — it works in dev
and breaks in production, silently.

## Tools

`web_search` and `x_search` are on by default. Both execute inside xAI, so
there is nothing to implement here and no second credential to hold — they cost
a flag in `.env`. Stormy is told not to narrate a search, so the only sign one is
running is the label under the status chip.

Remote **MCP** servers go in `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` as a JSON array, or in `mcp.json`
(gitignored), and are executed by xAI as well:

```json
[
  {
    "server_label": "orders",
    "server_url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
    "server_description": "Order lookup",
    "allowed_tools": ["lookup_order"],
    "authorization": "Bearer ..."
  }
]
```

Credentials in that file never leave the Node process. `/api/config` reports
tool *labels* only, which is what the strip under the composer renders.

Client-side function tools are the one kind not wired up: `session.tools` would
take them, but they need a `function_call_output` path back through the proxy's
allowlist, and nothing here has wanted one yet.

`src/client/stormy/` is a single-file prototype split into modules — the
original is kept at `prototype/umbrella-buddy.html` if you want to see where it
started. The split changed none of the prototype's numbers: the moods, the
springs and the canopy maths are the prototype's, verbatim. What the app adds
is who chooses the mood. `src/client/vendor/three-d-stage.js` is a copied
starter component with two local changes, listed at the top of the file —
re-copying it drops them.

The camera is the one thing the split did change. The framing is measured
against the widest and tallest the character ever gets — a canopy blown up over
its own crown — rather than against where it happens to be standing, and it
refits on resize, which the starter component's one-shot vertical framing
doesn't do. On a phone held upright that is the difference between an umbrella
and a wedge of one.

## States

`idle` · `listening` · `thinking` · `speaking` — each a set of targets for
tremor, lean, sway, sway speed, twirl and how hard the fabric ripples. It eases
between them, so transitions read as the same object changing mood rather than
a cut.

The call maps onto them directly: `listening` from `speech_started` and between
turns, `thinking` from `speech_stopped` until the first audio frame, `speaking`
while there is audio booked, `idle` when there is no call.

There are two moods no conversational state maps to.

`gust` is being talked over. The canopy snaps inside out, the whole rig
shudders, and it blends over whatever he was doing rather than replacing it,
decaying back over a couple of seconds.

`furled` is **what a broken API looks like.** A failed dial, a proxy that isn't
running, a missing key, an error mid-call — the fabric gathers down the shaft
and he packs himself away, and stays that way until something works again. The
caption says what broke; the furl is the part you can see from across the room,
and nothing else in the app causes it, so it never means anything else.

Nothing here is a sine wave dressed up as motion. Every visible movement is a
damped spring reacting to an impulse, and the canopy has a spring of its own —
`open` is sprung rather than set, which is why it pops past wide when it opens
and shudders when the wind takes it. While he talks, the shoves come from
onsets in the audio envelope, so the squash lands on consonants and it looks
like it is forming words.

## The transport seam

`session/index.js` exposes `on`, `start`, `stop`, `send`, `cancel`, `messages`,
`connected`, `busy`, `stale`, `state`, `model`, `voice` — and emits:

```
'state'        listening | thinking | speaking | idle
'caption'      the assistant transcript for this turn, in full
'user'         what the person said, in full
'level'        0..1 sustained amplitude, per frame
'pulse'        0..1 transient, one per discrete event
'interrupted'  the person talked over Stormy
'tool'         a label while a server-side tool works, or null
'busy'         whether a response is in flight
'ready'        { model, voice } the proxy actually used
'done'         { usage }
'error'        { message }
```

Both transcript events carry the whole turn rather than an increment. That is
an xAI divergence worth knowing about: it renames OpenAI's
`input_audio_transcription.delta` to `.updated` and makes it *cumulative*, so
appending it gives you "hello hello there hello there stormy". `events.js`
handles the two shapes apart — `.delta` appends, `.updated` replaces.

Stormy takes audio-shaped input, which is the whole point of the split:

```js
stormy.setState('speaking')  // idle | listening | thinking | speaking
stormy.setLevel(0.62)        // sustained amplitude 0..1, sampled per frame
stormy.pulse(0.4)            // transient impulse 0..1, one per discrete event
stormy.gust(0.9)             // talked over: the wind takes him
stormy.furl(true)            // the API is unreachable — or, with false, it's back
```

Swapping providers means writing a different `createVoiceSession()` with that
surface. `main.js` and Stormy do not change.
