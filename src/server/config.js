   all of them. It is the subset that suits this character: low, and
   sounding like it is standing outside in it.
   The light and airy end of the roster (`ara`, `eve`,
   `carina`, `luna`, `iris`, `celeste`, `lumen`, `lux`, `cosmo`, `sirius`,
   `altair`, `helios`) is deliberately absent — this one does not sound
   upbeat. `zagan` leads because it is the one that sounds like weather.

   xAI does have a voices endpoint now (`GET /v1/tts/voices`), but it returns
   the whole roster, which is the thing we are curating away from. An
   unrecognised XAI_VOICE is still honoured and shows up in the picker, so
   anything omitted here is a default we don't pick, not a voice we block. */
