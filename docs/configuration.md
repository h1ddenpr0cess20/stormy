# Configuration

Both `npm run dev` and `npm start` read `.env`.

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `XAI_API_KEY` | — | Required. Stays in the Node process. |
| `XAI_VOICE` | `helix` | Any of the 26 voices xAI publishes — the full list is in `.env.example`. Any other voice id is honoured and added to the picker. |
| `XAI_MODEL` | `grok-voice-latest` | Also `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` |
| `XAI_REALTIME_URL` | xAI | Points the proxy at a gateway or a stub |
| `XAI_WEB_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `XAI_X_SEARCH` | `true` | |
| `MEMORY` | `true` | The `remember` and `forget` tools, and the memory block in the prompt |
| `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` | — | JSON array of remote MCP servers, or put it in `mcp.json` |
| `PORT` | `5173` | |
| `SSL_KEY`, `SSL_CERT` | — | Paths to a real certificate; `npm start` then serves HTTPS |

## On a phone

```sh
npm run dev:lan           # → https://192.168.x.x:5173, printed on start
```

Microphone access needs a secure context. `localhost` is one; a LAN address over
plain HTTP is not — `navigator.mediaDevices` doesn't exist there, so the page
can't even raise the mic prompt. The `:lan` scripts serve HTTPS with a
self-signed certificate, cached in `node_modules/.vite/`, and the realtime
socket follows the page onto `wss:`.

No browser trusts that certificate, so the phone shows a warning the first time
("Advanced" → proceed on Chrome, "Show details" → "visit this website" on
Safari). Tap through it once per device. To skip it, point `SSL_KEY` and
`SSL_CERT` at a certificate the device already trusts —
[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) issues one for a LAN IP.

## Docker

```sh
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 -e XAI_API_KEY=xai-... h1ddenpr0cess20/stormy
```

Images go to Docker Hub on every push to `main` (`latest`) and on `v*` tags
(`1.2.3`, `1.2`), for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Configuration is the same
set of variables as `.env` — pass them with `-e` or `--env-file .env`.

The container serves HTTP on `PORT` and expects TLS to be terminated in front of
it; to serve TLS from the container, mount a certificate and set `SSL_KEY` and
`SSL_CERT`. Build it yourself with `docker build -t stormy .`. Publishing from a
fork needs a `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret, plus a `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` variable if
your Docker Hub account isn't `h1ddenpr0cess20`.

## Tools

`web_search` and `x_search` are on by default. Both execute inside xAI, so
there's nothing to implement here and no second credential to hold. Stormy is
told not to narrate a search; the only sign one is running is the label under
the status chip.

Remote MCP servers go in `XAI_MCP_SERVERS` as a JSON array, or in `mcp.json`
(gitignored), and are also executed by xAI:

```json
[
  {
    "server_label": "orders",
    "server_url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
    "server_description": "Order lookup",
    "allowed_tools": ["lookup_order"],
    "authorization": "Bearer ..."
  }
]
```

Credentials there never leave the Node process — `/api/config` reports tool
labels only. `remember` and `forget` are the two tools that run in the page
rather than at xAI.

## The log and the memory

`log` opens past conversations, newest first. `new` closes the record and, if a
call is up, dials again — the model's memory of what was said is the call
itself, so a new call is the only thing that clears it. `clear` asks once, then
removes the log.

`memory` opens the short list of details Stormy carries between calls. Ask him
to remember something and he calls `remember`; ask him to forget it and he calls
`forget`, which drops every stored line matching the keyword. You can also add a
line by hand, drop one, switch the whole thing off, or clear it. `MEMORY=false`
removes the tools and the prompt block for everyone the server serves.

Both live in `localStorage`, in the browser that made the call. Nothing is
uploaded, and the proxy keeps no copy of either — see the
[design notes](design.md#storage) for the caps and the wire format.
