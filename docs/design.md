# Design notes

How Stormy is put together. The [README](../README.md) covers running it;
[configuration](configuration.md) covers the knobs.

## How the call is wired

Every frame of audio goes through the Node process:

```
browser  ──ws──▶  /realtime  ──ws──▶  wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime
```

Unlike OpenAI's Realtime API, the browser can't dial xAI directly.
`/v1/realtime/client_secrets` takes no `session` field, so a page dialling xAI
itself would have to send its own `session.update` — putting the persona, the
tool list and any MCP `authorization` header in client code. The token also
lasts five minutes, and conversations routinely outlive that.

So the socket lives here and the page holds no credential. On connect the proxy
sends `session.update` — persona, voice, turn detection, audio format, tools —
before forwarding anything the page queued.

What the page may send upstream is an allowlist: audio frames, a typed message,
a request to respond, a cancel, and the output of a function call it ran itself.
Two things are dropped as persona overrides — a `session.update` from the
browser, and the `instructions` field on a `response.create`.
`test/server/realtime.test.js` covers that.

Frames from xAI are forwarded as bytes and mostly not read: audio deltas are
the bulk of the traffic, and parsing every one of them to find the occasional
tool call would not pay. A regex over the raw text picks out the three frames a
function call can arrive in — `response.output_item.done`,
`response.function_call_arguments.done`, and the `response.done` that repeats
it — and only those are parsed. A call to `forecast` is answered here: the proxy
fetches the weather, sends the result back as a `function_call_output`, and
follows it with `response.create`, without which the model waits forever on a
tool it asked for itself. Each call is answered once, whichever of the three
frames carried it.

Two frame types never reach xAI. `session.memory` carries what the page has
stored; the proxy folds those lines into the instructions and re-sends its own
`session.update`, so the persona stays here and the memories stay in the
browser. `session.tools` names the tools the page has switched off, and the
proxy re-declares the session without them — a subtraction only, checked against
the tools this server actually has, so a page can narrow what the model may
reach for and can never widen it.

## Audio

A WebSocket carrying base64 PCM leaves both directions to the client.

**Up:** an `AudioWorklet` (`public/pcm-worklet.js`) takes the mic at whatever
rate the hardware gives, resamples to 24 kHz with linear interpolation, and
posts 20 ms PCM16 frames. The `sampleRate` option on `AudioContext` is only a
hint, so the conversion is done rather than requested.

**Down:** chunks arrive faster than real time, so each is booked against a
cursor running ahead of the clock rather than played as it lands. That cursor is
also what makes barge-in work — interrupting drops everything booked but not yet
heard.

Turn-taking is server-side VAD. `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` tells the
page to drop its queue; a `response.created` arriving while audio is still
playing flushes it too, as a backstop. `Escape` cancels for the typed path.

The worklet lives in `public/` rather than being imported, because Vite inlines
small assets as `data:text/javascript` URLs and `addModule()` rejects those on
Safari and under any CSP that disallows `data:`.

## Storage

The log is one record per call under `stormy.history.v1`; memory is a list of
lines under `stormy.memory.v1`. Neither is uploaded — the proxy holds no copy of
either. The tool switches are a third,
`stormy.tools.v1`, holding the names that are switched *off* — so a tool nobody
has touched is on, and one the server gains later arrives on rather than
quietly missing.

The last 40 conversations are kept, and the oldest are shed to stay inside a
300 KB budget, since that space belongs to the whole origin. Private-mode Safari
hands back a store that throws on write, so the log falls back to memory for the
life of the page rather than failing the call.

Old turns are not replayed into a new call on their own — that would make the
log a memory rather than a record. `continue` on an entry in the log is the one
way past that, and it is asked for, once, per conversation.

What goes up then is the conversation itself, not a description of one. The page
sends `session.history` — its own frame, handled here and never forwarded — and
the proxy lays the turns back down upstream as items, one `conversation.item.create`
each: a user message carrying `input_text`, an assistant message carrying
`output_text`. That is the shape the realtime API takes for history, and it is
the only shape that works. Flattening a transcript into a single message leaves
the model with no history at all, only somebody telling it about one — it will
treat the first thing said in the new call as the first thing ever said.

Both roles carry `input_text`. xAI documents history seeding with a user text
message or an assistant text message and `input_text` as the content type for a
text message either way — it follows OpenAI's beta naming here, the same way it
does for the text events `events.js` has to handle two spellings of. OpenAI's GA
shape puts assistant text in `output_text`; that is not this API.

The turns arrive as turns rather than as items so the page never names a role:
it hands over what was said, and `realtime.js` decides what goes upstream. The
line explaining that those turns are an earlier conversation is part of the
instructions, so it stays server-side with the rest of the persona.

Both ends cap the replay at 40 turns and 6 KB, oldest shed first, and the cap is
a bill as well as a budget: xAI charges per `conversation.item.create` the client
sends, so a picked-up conversation costs its turns, once, at the moment it is
picked up. Lowering the cap lowers that; it is one constant at each end.

Memory is capped at 25 lines, each flattened to one line and cut at 600
characters; past the cap the oldest goes. `remember` and `forget` run in the
page against browser storage, and the result goes back up as a
`function_call_output`. Editing the list during a call re-sends
`session.memory`, so a memory added mid-conversation is live in it; switching
memory off empties the block on the next `session.update` without deleting
anything.

Memories are text the person typed or dictated, so they land inside the prompt.
Flattening and capping them in `persona.js` keeps a memory from opening a new
instruction paragraph, and the persona is always first in the string.

## The forecast

Weather is the one subject where a language model is reliably wrong: it cannot
know today's numbers, and a web search hands it somebody's prose about them. So
`forecast` is a function tool the proxy answers itself, out of Open-Meteo —
which is here rather than a paid API because it needs no key, which means there
is no credential in this process for the page to be kept away from.

`src/server/weather.js` does three things and nothing else: turns a place name
into a point on the earth, asks for that point's weather in the units the call
wants, and cuts the answer down to what someone would say out loud. Codes become
words, timestamps become clock times in the place's own zone, and every number
is rounded — a model handed `63.8199997` will eventually read all of it.

`run` never throws and never rejects. A tool call the model is waiting on has to
come back with something, so a place that doesn't exist, an API that is down and
a request that stalls all return `{ ok: false, error }` with a sentence in it.
Stormy reads the sentence rather than hanging.

Whether the page has the forecast switched off is deliberately not checked when
a call arrives. A switch thrown between the model asking and the frame landing
would otherwise leave it waiting on silence; the switch takes the tool out of
the next `session.update`, which is what stops it being called again.

## States

`idle` · `listening` · `thinking` · `speaking` — each a set of targets for
tremor, lean, sway, sway speed, twirl and how hard the fabric ripples. It eases
between them, so transitions read as a change of mood rather than a cut.

The call maps onto them directly: `listening` from `speech_started` and between
turns, `thinking` from `speech_stopped` until the first audio frame, `speaking`
while there is audio booked, `idle` when there is no call.

Two moods map to no conversational state:

- `gust` is being talked over. The canopy snaps inside out, the whole rig
  shudders, and it blends over whatever he was doing, decaying back over a
  couple of seconds.
- `furled` is what a broken API looks like — a failed dial, a proxy that isn't
  running, a missing key, an error mid-call. The fabric gathers down the shaft
  and he packs himself away until something works again. The caption says what
  broke; nothing else in the app causes it.

Every visible movement is a damped spring reacting to an impulse rather than a
sine wave, and the canopy has a spring of its own — `open` is sprung rather than
set, which is why it pops past wide when it opens and shudders when the wind
takes it. While he talks the impulses come from onsets in the audio envelope, so
the squash lands on consonants.

`src/client/stormy/` is the single-file prototype at
`prototype/umbrella-buddy.html` split into modules, with its numbers kept
verbatim — the moods, the springs and the canopy maths are unchanged. What the
app adds is who chooses the mood. `src/client/vendor/three-d-stage.js` is a
copied starter component with two local changes, listed at the top of the file —
re-copying it drops them.

The camera is the one thing the split did change. The framing is measured
against the widest and tallest the character ever gets — a canopy blown up over
its own crown — rather than where it happens to be standing, and it refits on
resize, which the starter component's one-shot vertical framing doesn't do. On a
phone held upright that's the difference between an umbrella and a wedge of one.

## The transport seam

`session/index.js` exposes `on`, `start`, `stop`, `send`, `cancel`,
`syncMemory`, `syncTools`, `messages`, `context`, `connected`, `busy`, `stale`,
`state`, `muted`, `model`, `voice` — and emits:

```
'state'        listening | thinking | speaking | idle
'caption'      the assistant transcript for this turn, in full
'user'         what the person said, in full
'level'        0..1 sustained amplitude, per frame
'pulse'        0..1 transient, one per discrete event
'interrupted'  the person talked over Stormy
'tool'         a label while a tool works, or null
'message'      a completed turn, { role, content } — what the log stores
'busy'         whether a response is in flight
'ready'        { model, voice } the proxy actually used
'memory'       the result of a remember/forget the model just called
'done'         { usage }
'error'        { message }
```

Both transcript events carry the whole turn rather than an increment. xAI
renames OpenAI's `input_audio_transcription.delta` to `.updated` and makes it
cumulative, so appending it gives you "hello hello there hello there stormy".
`events.js` handles the two shapes apart — `.delta` appends, `.updated`
replaces.

Stormy takes audio-shaped input:

```js
stormy.setState('speaking')  // idle | listening | thinking | speaking
stormy.setLevel(0.62)        // sustained amplitude 0..1, sampled per frame
stormy.pulse(0.4)            // transient impulse 0..1, one per discrete event
stormy.gust(0.9)             // talked over: the wind takes him
stormy.furl(true)            // the API is unreachable — or, with false, it's back
```

Swapping providers means writing a different `createVoiceSession()` with that
surface. `main.js` and Stormy don't change.
